pillars:
1. inheritance
    - child classes inherit from super classes
    - real world example: 0 code related stuff in example
    - do child parents - dna shared among each other is inherited from parent to child
1. abstraction
    - hiding complex implementation details - the user doesn't need to know the complexity behind a method, just that it works
    - this applies for both other developers using your implementations, as well as end users
    - use the remote example - a remote controls a tv, but we don't 
1. polymorphism
    - polymorphism means that an instance of one thing is also an instance of another thing at the same time
    - polymorphism means many forms
    - how we modify our information
    - water - water can be solid, liquid, or gas, it has many states but remains fundamentally the same
1. encapsulation
    - sort of like the security side of abstraction
    - allows us to have a modularized system depending on the access provided to a class or variable
    - boxing vs unboxing - 
    - vending machine - don't have direct access to the machine's contents, only with a predetermined way
