# p1 recommendations
sessions middleware - might be worth using for setting up certain sessions for people logging in
- might not need this just cuz of identity??
- but might come in handy for the sake of transferring data
- look into viewbag and viewdata maybe too
- whenever controllers get created and destroyed the data is redone basically
- but yeah sessions is good for transferring data around

# material review
- software, platforms, infastructre are types of stuff as a service in the cloud
