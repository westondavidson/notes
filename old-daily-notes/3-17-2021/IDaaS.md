- 6 tables or more - as complex as p1 database
- 3rd party authentication
- have REST API backend
- angular frontend
- how do we add authentication to this? research ourselves
- pipelines
- scrum for teams
- once teams are finalized, submit team members and proposal with a list of functionalities that we will use
- 3rd party API AS WELL OTHER THAN authentication
okta, auth0 any identity as a service provider for authentication
- systems must be async
- sooner or later we will need to use this security topic with our REST API - CORS!!!
- httpclient seems to help a decent amount for verifying stuff. used to make requests to other services from an asp.net api
- look into ignoring folders containing boilerplate/scaffolded code
- send pdf of the proposal - a proper project proposal
- implement scrum, have a project board

[Project Name] is a step sequencer that allows users to create, play back, save, and export music they've created in [Project Name]. The sequencer will rely heavily on the Tone.js API for front-end logic. Users will be able to create accounts and persist sequencer settings between user sessions. [Project Name] will allow users to dynamically add and remove samples from their sequencer.
