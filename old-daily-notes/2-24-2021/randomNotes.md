# quick review
- sql constraints are enforce the formatting for a column - could be a pk, fk, data type, not null, etc
- normalization is the process of converting your database to avoid duplicate columns and inappropriate interactions
    - makes data easier to manage, the art of organizing our data
- 2NF, if you have a composite key you shouldn't have data that's dependent only on one half of the composite key

- SQL sublanguages and normalization will likely be asked about in QC
- transactions will be asked about, but they won't be discussed until tomorrow

# SQL Topic for our group:
- Functions in SQL Server

- P0 stuff will be covered again tomorrow morning thank the lord
