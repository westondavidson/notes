# CI
- continuous integration is all about making sure that your codebase is updated with the newest versions all the time
- in implementation, ci is all about merging stable code that works into the codebase - how do we ensure that the codebase that we're merging is stable
- ci is separate from the concept of a pipeline
- the main goal of ci is that you're merging current code into main codebase

# branches in git
- you utilize branches to work on features
- different people work on different features
- staging comes in by grouping changes together in a logical way that makes sense so when you commit, you can come back to a reasonable state in program


container virtualizes os, so you just plug in a virtual filesystem on top of it
