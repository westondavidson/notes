# designing UI for the visually impaired
- there are different levels of visual impairment, ranging from color blindness, to legally blind, to full-on blind
- loss of acuity, ghosting vision - images appear blurry

- accessibility options that adapt to different styles might be a better approach than trying to design one UI for ALL types of blindness
- make sure to use alt text for any sort of images used
- use high contrast color pairings
    - ensure that the contrast ratio is at least 4:5:1 between text and background
- make use of textures!!
    - using different textured background shapes can help with differentiating one area from another

- use icons, vibrations, and text - all 3 if possible! to indicate right and wrong actions taken by the user in an application
- have a very clearly defined set of sounds, icons, and vibrations that indicate a certain status

- MINIMALISTIC
    - not only is minimalism aesthetically pleasing, it will allow all types of users to interact with the app in a fluid, meaningful way - blind or not. Also challenging to be truly minimalistic



things that absolutely SHOULD be used, regardless of type of blindness:
- high-contrast color palette
- alt text/labels
- textured(actually patterned) backgrounds with a consistent theme for their action type
- 

- each action that a user can take should be represented by a color, explicit text, a patterned background, and an icon

design choices:
font: Proxima Nova Bold
