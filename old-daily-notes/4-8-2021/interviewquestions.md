- abstract class vs interface
    - abstract classes can have constructors
    - abstract classes can have non abstract methods that don't need to be overwritten
- dependency injection
    - allows abstract implementation of class instead of concrete
- index
    - index is a value corres

- polymorphism, method overloading and method overriding

- abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance
- abstraction is the act of hiding implementations behind a simplified interface or version of system to end user
    - using interfaces is a way to apply abstraction in your code
    - abstraction 
- polymorphism - a class or object can be treated as another type within it's hierarchy
- inheritance - a class can inherit from a hierarchy of parents - increases code reusability
- encapsulation - the act of hiding data within a certain scope to prevent access from anything outside of it
    - data wrapping and data hiding
- sql
    - difference between a primary key and a foreign key
        a primary key is a unique identifier for a specific table, and a foreign key is a reference to the primary key of another table
    - self join
        - a self join is a join where a table is joined with the same table
        - you could do a self join on a table that has customers and cities in order to group customers by cities
    - sql sublanguages
        - ddl, dml, tcl, dcl
    - delete will delete data and keep a record, truncate will remove the data but not remove the table itself (and also deletes everything permanently), and drop drops a whole table
    - table of employees, commissions in month they made
        - give employee with third highest commission
        - select * from employee order by commission desc limit 1 offset 2; *** remember this they will probably ask during panels, interviews, etc.
    - panels REALLY dig in on first two weeks of training
