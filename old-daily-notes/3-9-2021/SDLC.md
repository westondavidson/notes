# software development life cycle
- the process used to design, develop and test high quality softwares
- sdlc - software development life cycle
            - SCRUM is a practice to generate software quickly (unrelated to sdlc)
- this is a soft requirement for steps - this is a big generic term for developing software
1. planning
1. defining
1. designing
1. building
1. testing
1. deployment
1. repeat!

# big bang model
1. design
1. build
1. test
- good for prototypes, learning new languages and implementing some new feature without integrating it into the application
- just a way to get an idea out there, but not great for large scale projects


# waterfall model
- rigid, highly documented
- you go through each phase once
- good for projects that require on time delivery
    - stuff like software for rockets, military projects, etc.

# v model
- verification and validation model
- an extension of waterfall model
    - extension of testing phase for each corresponding development stage
- basically each phase has a corresponding additional testing phase

# agile
- agile is more of a concept than an actual methodology unlike the first three models
- about being able to develop and deploy software quickly by not wasting time discussing design and planning
- this is all about communicating consistently with clients and stakeholders
- less about documentation, more about communication and rapid development
- really good for software that's "never done"
    - always introducing new features, adapting to new technologies

# scrum
- scrum is a methodology for quickly turning through projects
- scrum includes:
1. sprint planning
1. daily scrum/standup
1. determine definition of "done"
1. sprint review
    - all about reviewing the code and features added to code base
1. sprint review/retro
    - all about people centered retrospective
    - review what happened during the sprint with the people
1. sprint again!
- basically your ph
- scrum artifacts:
    1. backlog
    - contains user stories that need to be implemented
    - assess which user stories need to be implemented based on urgency and match the total points against total amount of work/human power
    - probably want to overestimate how much you can do, so you can try to overachieve
    1. project board
    - take a user story from backlog, then assign it to project board
    - story, todo, in progress, to verify, done
    - basically break down the story into what's needed to be done vs what's in progress for that feature
    - there are different online project boards! Azure devops will provide project board
    1. burndown chart
    - when a user story is done, move down the leftover
    - a way of keeping track of your progress during a sprint
    - used in sprint review to see the sprint's velocity
    - consider who you want on ur team :flushed_emoji:
- a scrum master is different than a team lead - it's the person who leads the standups and updates data in project board etc.
    - checks in with team leads to make sure everyone is on the same page

- a user story is a way of describing requirements that a user would need to have in a system in order to complete a task
