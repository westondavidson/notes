# how are styles applied
- we apply styles using rules
- rules are a key value pair of the element to style, and the style that should be applied
- for example, the rule color:yellow changes the font color of the selected element to yellow
- selectors are used to group these rules together
- using selectors we can define a set of style rules for a certian group of elements.

    - order - most specific to least specific
    1. inline

    1. class/attribute/pseudo-class
    1. element/pseudo-element
