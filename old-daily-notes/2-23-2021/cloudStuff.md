# cloud services
- azure, aws, and google cloud are all data places for hosting!
- these are basically server farms
- these companies have all the hardware, so we can just rent the resources from them :) 

- say you need a database, you can host your database using azure!
- data isn't going to be stored locally, instead in azure cloud.

- you should shut down the server after we're finished with the p0 and p1 to avoid any fees on azure

- p2 will be using postgresql!

- a resource group is basically a way to group the azure resources you create. sort of like a sln in c#
    - could include your DB, any app services for deployment, etc.
