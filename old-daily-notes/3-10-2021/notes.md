# daily stuff
- this morning we'll learn about deploying an app - won't be using containers today
- we have a coding challenge in the afternoon, then afterwards we'll do P1
- tomorrow is devops day

# docker review
- in the docker file, you basically set up your virtual file system to send to the image.
- afterwards, you want to remove the stuff that is unnecessary
- then we have a nice, stripped down system that doesn't get bogged down by extra stuff
- this is sort of how a dockerfile is built

# git
- branches in git are isolated repos so you can add new features
    - a separate line of development
    - code that is separated out from the derived "truth" branch
- pull requests is when you request for your changes to be pulled into another branch
- if two people try to pull request in the same area of code/same file and they both submit pull requests

# sdlc
- sdlc is a loose term for the process people use to develop code from planning, to development, to construction
- there are some solid types of sdlc implementations, like waterfall, v-method, big bang
- agile is the loose idea that communication with clients is more important than 

dynamic testing - occurs during runtime of code, to determine if it's actually 
static testing - doesn't run our code to perform analysis - example is sonar cloud because it's analyzing code before it's run
