# SWOT
- swot helps assess where life/careers can go
- ask questions about each four areas being examined
- don't only limit current strengths that are currently active, also dormant

- good at naturally, what do other people see, values and ethics set you apart, etc.

- weaknesses
- bad habits, weaknesses, what can improve, most likely to avoid

- opportunities
    - state of the economy, new technology, needs that are not being filled, etc.
    - look at strengths, ask if they open opportunities

- threats
    - weaknesses that affect goals, professional standards, learning requirements


- convert weaknesses and threats into strengths and opportunities

- threats are external and not necessarily in your control

- make use of the time as much as you can - ask soft skill questions first then tech questions


- tell me about yourself
- did you feel that your teammates liked working with you in previous team-based projects?
- How open are you to learning new technologies for this position?

- tell me about yourself
    - decent
- challenges in projects
    - getting pipeline in microsoft azure to sonarcloud and displaying code coverage detail
    - sounds technically knowledged in devops area, a little bit challenging at the start but once you began flowing you did really well with describing the technologies used

- OOP pillars
    - knew all 4
    - knew examples of inheritance
    - knew example of polymorphism
        - might be worth mentioning boxing/unboxing, a form of polymorphic typing
    - encapsulation good

- polymorphism example in dev
    - a good one might be boxing/unboxing
    - polymorphism is a little sketchy

- observable in angular
    - not known
- data binding in angular
    - property binding, event binding, two way binding, "expression" (i think he meant interpolation)

- piping in angular - how do you make something toupper
    - interesting solution with 2 way binding
    - pipe in angular - not known
    - basically a way to format/transform data in template given a pipe method - toupper, datepipe, tolower, etc.

- how to build a pipeline
    - strong knowledge of azure devops setup for azure pipeline
    - knows how to build out a yml pipeline file very well, comes off very experienced

- scenario - someone is attempting to access a file in angular that points to a webserver that is not in same domain
    - CORS policy issue - by default, most browsers don't allow for cross origin domain file sharing. this can be circumnavigated by using a cors proxy, or configuring CORS policy on image host/inside app to allow retrieval.

    - knows dml
    - knows dcl
