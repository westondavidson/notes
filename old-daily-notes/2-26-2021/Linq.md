# Linq

- Linq is a language-integrate query to perform query syntax even outside of a database
- provides a way to "link" to objects without just giving the developer the responsibility of writing sql/protecting against sql injection
- the syntax doesn't change between sql vendors - with linq you just need one interface that says what you want to do in c#, then queries the database as needed
- 
# linq queries
- the parts of your query
    - the data source (our db)
    - the query
    - the query execution
