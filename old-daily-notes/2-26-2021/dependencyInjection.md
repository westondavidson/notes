# dependency injection
- the idea that new glue
    - you don't want to tie concrete to concrete
- major part is just making sure implementation is not tightly coupled

- you're listing out the stuff that your class actually implements in the constructor
- by tying interfaces together with dependency injection, 

- other dependency injection perks:
- because your class dependencies are being exposed you know what components to mock
