- n x n matrix of of positive numbers
taking a 3 by 3 and converting it into a 3 by 3

convert a to b by doing a-b

you 

find the smallest possible changes to make

adjust the numbers so that the sum of the verticals and sum of horizontals all result in the same sum

so each value needs to be unique, and each row needs to add up to 15
check all rows, columns and diagonals if sum is 15 - if not, then modify then so that the sum is 15
