Hello, my name is Weston Davidson. I graduated from Daytona State college with a Bachelor’s of science in information technology. During my time in school, I served as the resident webmaster for the student newspaper, leveraging the power of the WordPress CMS to publish articles online, perform SEO, and attend regular meetings to discuss the future of the student newspaper content. As an undergraduate, I also did some limited freelance work to design and publish websites for small business clients, primarily using the WordPress CMS.
After graduation, I took a position with Revature, where I have completed a number of projects related to my primary tech stack (.net framework, Angular, PostgreSQL/relational databases, Microsoft Azure).
These projects include a solo store web application called SineShop which leveraged MVC architecture for development as well as the Microsoft Identity framework for authentication and authorization. 
From there, I went on to work as team lead for our small groups project, where I led the team to design a music creation and publishing platform. This project leveraged technologies including Angular 11, the tone.js web API, service-oriented architecture, an agile development style, and regular team lead duties such as assigning tasks and maintaining team communication via a Trello board and conducting daily standups
Afterwards, the RevMixer project I was a part of went so well that Revature asked the entire class to work together on RevMixer for our final project. I assumed the role of front-end team lead, so I have had a very nice opportunity to enrich myself in Angular development over the past few weeks. The front-end team lead role consisted of managing team members in an appropriate way and regularly attending daily team lead meetings to ensure consistent communication across all teams.
Overall, I feel very comfortable learning new technologies in a fast-paced environment. I like to think of myself a bit like a squirrel, where I am attracted to any sort of new shiny technology that I spot and can’t help but to want to learn about it. Overall, because of that, I am a hard worker and eager learner. I am confident that I could be a strong asset to your organization.



## Angular has been COVERED
    - I understand
        - Angular framework structure (components, modules, services, routing)
        - Angular directives (component, attribute, structural)
        - Angular decorators (component directives)
        - Angular binding (event, property, two way, interpolation)
        - NPM (node package manager, bundles node.js and allows for including node and angular libraries)
        - node.js (local development environment for javascript/typescript based applications)
        - AngularJS vs Angular2/angular 11 (angular 11 is a framework, uses typescript instead of javascript, uses binding, has a cli, uses directives)
## MVC - Let's do it
    - I understand
        - MVC lifecycle (routing, controller, action, view response)
        - MVC Design pattern (what happens in the model, view, and controller)
        - Razor engine (a view rendering engine that combines the ability to write c# in HTML and render to html/js)
## C# - I think I already know most of this luckily
## SQL - I feel reasonably confident, as long as the code exercise isn't sql related.


- this is a group presentation
- everyone has to be able to speak
- as a whole batch, who's gonna go first, next, etc
- talk about an overview of what revmixer is
- why is it important?
- tech stack
- demo
- talk about project, showcase project board, burndown chart, stats, code coverage

- need more slides that show what we did during the project
each team member, make a slide to talk about your tasks
