- sent via email plus docusign
- try to impress your client and try to get permanent positions at the contract position!
- transitions normally happen after a year
- relocation agreement
    - only applies if you are relocating after training
    - no interest rate on advances for any extended advances you need, up to 1000 dollars
    - might be able to team up with batchmates if someone else gets the same location as you!
- industry equivalency reports will be available on our portfolio afterwards
- revature sets up interviews based on the skillset result from this industry equivalency report
- 8 out of 10 clients get sent to one location but those other 20% get relocated, is there a limit to how many times we can be relocated or are there fringe cases where one person gets unlucky and gets reassigned 3 or 4 times
