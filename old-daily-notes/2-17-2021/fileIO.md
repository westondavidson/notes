# FileIO

- we need a way to convert our data source (either a file, database, etc.) to our program!
    - we do this using a byte stream
    - a byte stream is a stream of bytes used to write and read to a file.
    - can be thought of as a bridge between c# code and the file
    - when you use a bytestream make sure to dispose of it using a using statement/block
- a character stream is used to write characters to a file



# abstracted file handling
- you can have abstracted methods of file handling that can call these methods under the hood - research these options too!
