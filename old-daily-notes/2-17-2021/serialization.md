# Serialization
-   the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file
- Deserialization is the reverse - unpack a serialized object to be used in a project as an object
- custom text is a pretty good way to serialize using XML and JSON
- when you deserialize, you have to enforce type <> to make sure you deserialize into a type you are expecting.
