# Extended Modifiers - non access
- keyword modifiers/extended modifiers
- used to modify the declaration of types and type members
- abstract
    - applied to classes and class members
    - allows you to create classes and members that are incomplete and must be implemented in a derived class
- const
    - applied to fields!
    - fields that cannot be modified!! never changing
    - numbers, booleans, strings, null
- readonly
    - applies to fields, structs, and struct members
    - you can't assigned after constructor exits
    - const has to be initialized, readonly can be initialized later on inside the object constructor
    - if a value depends on what gets called but should never change afterwards, this is useful
- sealed
    - sort of like final keyword in java
    - when a class is sealed, it cannot be inherited
    - if a method is sealed, it can't be overridden
- static
    - static applies to classes and class members which belong to the type itself rather than a specific object
    - you wouldn't need to instantiate an object of the type to access a static method
    - a static variable would be the same for all instances of that type - it is universally shared
    - a static class can only have static members
    - static classes are sealed, and therefore cannot be inherited
- virtual
    - basically saying that this method, property, indexer, or event CAN be overridden by a derived class
- override
    - required to extend or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of a property, indexer or event

- worth reading about "what's the difference between method hiding and method overriding?"
- private public protected internal - the access modifiers
