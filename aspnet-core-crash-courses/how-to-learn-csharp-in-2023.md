## video review
- good information, will use to further my learning. I think for me, it will be better to start with an OOP principles course review, and then jump into a C sharp syntax review, but the basics definitely do seem valuable to learn.
- I also like the idea of writing console apps for automation, tasks and jobs before jumping into web apps.

# Learning Order
1. syntax
    - not really the important part, need to know the logic for when to use syntax
1. debugging
    - going to be needed all the time
    - make sure you know skills and tools for this
1. OOP
    - need to understand fundamentals of OOP
    - if you use more advanced things first, then you'll think of them as magic when they work without understanding why they work
        - then, when something breaks, you'll have no idea why
1. Desktop project types
    - even if you want to be a web dev, know how to build desktop apps too, at least how they work
    - there are times when a desktop app would be a better choice
        - automation - console app put into task scheduler, or put them into a windows service to run something.
        - automation is good for this stuff, and you wouldn't want it in a web app.
1. ASP.NET Core
    - big category
        - covers API, razer pages, MVC, others
        - used for web applications
1. Data Access
    - know how to get information in and take information back out
        - the whole purpose of an app is to put data in, and get info out
        - the app might do some work on the data but that's really what all apps do
        - know how to store data in many places, not just one
            - know more than just SQL - learn SQLlite, mongodb, APIs, etc
1. Dependency Injection
    - asp.net core dependency injection is built in
        - other things don't have it, but it's very important to know
        - teaches how to decouple stuff, make better apps
1. HTML/CSS
    - understand at LEAST the basics
    - learn about HTML5 and CSS3
    - DOM
    - learning modern web is important
1. Javascript
    - learn JS before you use a framework
        - don't go to react, view, angular beforehand
1. Azure
    - dabble in cloud platforms a decent bit
    - cloud can be very cheap to support a business
    - good for cost effective decisions on things
1. Docker
    - know the basics of using, creating docker images, etc
    - great for just about everything from cloud, microservices, to desktop
1. SQL
1. GIT


## Learning Steps
1. Learn a small topic or item
    - focus on one thing at a time
        - example: learn if statements and practice, focus only on that
1. practice the basics
    - don't skip over PRACTICE
    - just because you watched or read about something doesn't mean you know it
    - you need to do it so you can validate that what you read actually works
1. practice the edge cases
    - test using the different possible scenarios
1. repeat
    - practice every topic at least twice
    - makes sure you can do everything right the first time

- just put enough code in to practice what you just learned, nothing else, so you know for SURE how to do the one thing
- then, you can move on to edge cases to validate you understand how the thing works..
- make sure the thing you're practicing works the way you expect it to
- go further than what the tutorial or video has taught, try different cases
    - by doing this you have an example in your own thought process rather than someone else's
    - documentation for what you've learned


## tips and tricks
- practice isn't extra, it's essential
- don't get distracted by flashy project types
    - don't jump around betweeen stuff before you've learned the other thing
    - take time, follow path, and THEN go on once you've learned that one thing well
    - if you jump around, you'll never be able to become a software developer
- stick to the plan and learn in order
    - don't bounce around, give up etc.
    - there will be hard days, you have to do it
    - a person who will stick with something is who will do well at this
- pace yourself
    - marathon, not a sprint
    - don't cram everything in a single week
- evaluate progress and continually improve
    - look back and see how you can learn and retain better
