## Namespaces
- namespaces are groups that have classes which have functions that can be used in your app
- we make our own namespaces as well for the same purpose, to import these classes to other parts of your app

## classes
- allow you to model something
    - provide attributes, methods, etc


- Static
    - this function can run without creating an object previously
    - this function doesn't need to be instantiated to be used if it's declared static
- void
    - will not return anything


- conversion
    - explicit conversion
        - when you lose data, it's an explicit conversion
    - implicit conversion
        - when you're converting from a smaller to a larger data type, so nothing is being lost
